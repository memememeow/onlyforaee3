1. Describe problems you've encountered:
Our group begins from implementing ext2_ls.c and we found that, ext2_ls.c
is the "core" of the whole program, since the "trace_path" helper function
is highly important and is used in all other programs (ext2_cp.c, ext2_ln.c,
ext2_mkdir.c, ext2_rm.c and ext2_rm_bonus.c). Implementing "trace_path" helper
function is one of the problem we encountered.

2. Any special design decisions you've taken:
The main functions in our group are short. Our group use many helper functions
in order to bread down the hard problems into small pieces. Actually, the
"bread down piece" design makes our test and debug much easier and faster.
We just need to find the helper function which has problem and solve it, then
the whole program can then functioning well.

3. Describes what features you have completed:
Our group completed the features described in ext2_ls.c, ext2_cp.c, ext2_ln.c,
ext2_mkdir.c, ext2_rm.c and ext2_rm_bonus.c in the handout and implements our
program as much as possible the same as ext2 file system and Linux system.
In conclusion, we implement the operations on the directory:
Search: - Find a particular file within directory
Create file: - Add a new entry to the directory
Delete file: - Remove an entry from the directory
List directory: - Return file names and requested attributes of entries

4. Similarity among these 6 programs:
ext2_ls.c: LIST (read)
ext2_cp.c, ext2_ln.c, ext2_mkdir.c: CREATE (write/modify)
ext2_rm.c, ext2_rm_bonus.c: DELETE (write/modify)
